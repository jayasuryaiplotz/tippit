A simple Tipping app bult with Fusetools, originally built over 24 hours at Uhack Hackathon in Manila Philippines. Developers are Mark Vernon, Jayasurya, John Tan and Herman  

The app uses the Tagcash.com API (http://developer.tagcash.com) and the Tagcash Fiat Blockchain. Mode details on the blockchain and how to connect to it at http://tagcash.com

When developing the app, you will need a client_id and client_secret which you can get from tagcash.com or developer.tagcash.com websites

There are 3 ways to tip

1. Generate a QR code and let others scan it to get the tip. 60 seconds duration befire it expires

2. Scan someone elses personal QR code

3. Send tip to email. If that user does not have an account they receiver gets an email notifying them of a tip, and 3 days to claim it by registering.
